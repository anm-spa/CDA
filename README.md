This tool is developed based on clang/LLVM using the Libtooling infrastructure to analyse the control dependency of intraprocedural programs. This directory should be placed inside the clang/tools directory of the llvm project. See the documentation of the Libtooling  infrastructure (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html). Building the llvm will also build this tool automatically and will produce the "clang-cda" executables.


Given any source code file, this tool will compute the weak and strong control closure of a set of CFG nodes. For each of them, two different algorithms are implemented:

There are several options that can be given in the command line:
-alg=WCCfast (Compute WCC using method 2)
-alg=WCCdan (Compute WCC using method 1)
-alg=SCCfast (Compute SCC using method 2)
-alg=SCCdan (Compute SCC using method 1)
-alg=WCC (Compute WCC using method 1 and 2 and compare the execution time and results)
-alg=SCC (Compute SCC using method 1 and 2 and compare the execution time and results)
-alg=ALL (Compute WCC and SCC using method 1 and 2 and compare the execution time and results)

Three debug lebels exist:
-dl=l0 (only print the final results)
-dl=l1 (print results for each procedure individually)
-dl=l2 (print extended debug info)

It is possible to analyze a single procedure in a source code. In that case, give the option -proc=<procedure name>
  
All methods compute the control closure of Np which is a subset of all CFG nodes N. Np is selected randomly in all algorithms. Np can be given only if -proc=<procedure name> option is used along with -dl=l2
